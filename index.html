        <p>Welcome to my Three.js Demonstration!</p>

        <h2>How Three.js Works</h2>
        <p>
          Three.js functions on Three Basic Principles which can be compared to directing a movie. 
          As a director, you need your actors, your setting, your lights. These are all filmed by the camera, 
          which then views the action unfold. This is the same way that Three.js functions. 
        </p>
        <h3>Scenes</h3>
        <p>
          Scenes are collections of graphical objects, your actors, that are spacially represented 
          on a web page in a 3d environment. In this scene, you can see the rotating torus in the background, 
          the cube with me on it, the moon, the stars, and the background image. In addition, 
          lighting needs to be set up so that these objects can be seen. 
          <br><br>
          Lighting enables objects to have different textures, appearances and depth 
          creating a diverse range of graphical capability. 
        </p>
        <h3>Cameras</h3>
        <p>
          Cameras are your viewport into the scene. The camera in this scene rotates and adjusts with the page
          scrolling showing you different aspects of the scene as your scroll. 
        </p>
        <h3>Rendering</h3>
        <p>
          This is where the action happens! All of the scene objects and the camera need to be rendered. The renderer needs to be constructed in a way 
          that meets the needs of your specific page. For instance, on this page, the rendering is the full screen with 
          the same aspect ratio of the screen. This will adjust depending on the screen that you view this page from!
          <br><br> 
          You can also see that the actors are not static. For instance the torus is constantly being rendered in new positions. Additionally, as you scroll, 
          other objects in the scene are rendered in different positions too! This creates action in a web page, enhancing user experience!

        <h2>Scene Building and User Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Adding a variety of interesting objects to a scene can draw user's attention. It's very pleasant to see
          different shapes, movement, and color's on webpages when the vast majority of the web consists of crisp static 
          layouts of text. While cleanliness is also an important aspect of a webpage's design, it can also give the same 
          effect as walking into an office building of neat cubicles. Mixing clean crisp design with neat visuals and action
          make it seem like you are instead visiting a hip new tech hq. Such as <a href="https://officesnapshots.com/2013/06/10/google-dublin-office-design-headquarters/">Google's Dublin Campus.</a>

        <h2>How Enabling Creativity leads to Diversity</h2>
        <p>
        Three.js toolset enables developers to create dynamic and interesting web environments. 
        With a broad toolset, comes a range of possibilities in design. This lends to creativity and 
        a more seamless flow of bringing a developer's imagination to life on screen. 
        <br><br> 
        The importance of this is that web developer's are not constricted. They can build what their minds desire. 
        In this way, a wide array of ideas can be cast to the internet creating an equally wide array of diversity in web experiences. 
        This also makes standing out from the crowd not only attainable, but easy!
